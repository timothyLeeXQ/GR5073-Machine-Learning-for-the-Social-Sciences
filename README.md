# GR5073: Machine Learning for the Social Sciences Assignments

This repo contains assignments for the class GR5073: Machine Learning for the Social Sciences, offered by the Columbia University Quantitative Methods in Social Science department. The class and its assignments aim to provide a "comprehensive overview of machine learning as it is applied in a number of domains", with emphasis on comparison and synthesis between machine learning approaches and traditional regression based inference in the social sciences.

Course assignments and assessments focused on:
* Providing practice with packages covered in class, including:
  - Pandas - Assignment 1
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn - Assignment 1 and 2
  - scikit-learn - Assignments 2, 3, and Mid-term
  - keras - Assignment 4 and Final Exam
* Assessing students' understanding of Machine Learning techniques - Mid-term and Final Exam

The course covered the underlying concepts of Machine Learning algorithms and associated techniques alongside practical demonstrations on applying these techniques using Python packages. Full details are provided in the Course Syllabus.
