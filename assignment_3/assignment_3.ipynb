Present any figures that assist you in your analysis.\n","\n","### Overall\n","The hierarchical clustering model with 6 clusters managed to segregate best, from good from poor, just like with the k-means. However, it also seemed to be able to clearly distinguish best (purple), good (brown), average (blue and green), poor (yellow), from very bad (red). It seems to have done better than k-means in this respect. It also seems to have allowed separation of great, from good, from poor, just like with k-means, though perhaps not with as many variables. However, the purple and red clusters are very small. Most points are blue.\n","\n","### Cluster with good wines (brown, purple)\n","- Extreme fixed acidity - brown points tended to have high fixed acidity, whereas purple points tended to have lower fixed acidity. In the case of purple points, the points with high fixed acidity tended to have good ratings. For brown points, high fixed acidity avoided the worst ratings, but were well represented at slightly below average to excellent ratings.\n","- Extreme total sulfur dioxide - brown points tended to have low total sulfulr dioxide, whereas purple points tended to have high total sulfur dioxide. Purple points with high sulfur dioxide had strong ratings, while brown points with low sulfur dioxide avoided the worst ratings, but were well represented at slightly below average to excellent ratings.\n","- Low volatile acidity - The purple cluster has a high spike at a low fixed acidity level, and few points above or below it. A low fixed acidity seems to cluster with the best wines. Brown clusters also tended to have a lower volatile acidity, and above average quality scores.\n","- Low levels of sulfates - Similar to volatile acidity. Brown points tended to have lower sulfates levels, with purple points having a high spike at a low sulfate level. In the case of purple points, the points with high fixed acidity tended to have good ratings. For brown points, high fixed acidity avoideded the worst ratings, but were well represented at slightly below average to excellent ratings.\n","- Higher alcohol content - higher alcohol content seemed to have more purple and brown points with high ratings. Lower alcohol content levels had few of these points, and they tended to receive lower quality judgements.\n","  - Although blue seems to be widely represented amongst high alcohol content and higher quality in their scatterplot, this is likely due to blue being the largest cluster (see distribution plot, blue is actually less represented at higher alcohol content levels, while brown and purple are better represented)\n","  - While these blue points seem to outperform brown/purple in the scatterplot, brown is still a good presence despite being a smaller cluster at higher quality levels, with above average alcohol. Purple's only visible point is at the 2nd best quality judgement.\n","- Low density - purple is hard to see in the scatterplot due to low number of samples, but it the distribution plot shows it tends to have lower density than the other distributions, while having higher quality judgements\n","\n","\n","### Cluster with lower quality wines (other clusters)\n","- Mid fixed acidity - middle levels of fixed acidity tended to contain points from the yellow and red clusters. These points also tended to have blue points with the lowest judgements of quality.\n","- High volatile acidity - red and yellow points tended to have higher volatile acidity levels.\n","\n","### Making a good bottle of wine\n","#### Go big or go home with fixed acidity\n","- Either go for something with high fixed acidity or low fixed acidity.\n","\n","#### Avoid volatile acidity, sulfates\n","- Higher volatile acidity tends to result in poorer wines. Avoid this.\n","\n","#### Alcohol content\n","- Higher alcohol content is associated with good wines\n","\n","### Difference from kMeans\n","The two algorithms mostly identified the same variables as being important for making a good wine - fixed and volatile acidity, as well as alcohol content are important. There are some notable differences.\n","- Sulfates - did not seem to affect kMeans algorithm, but affected hierarchical clustering\n","- Sulfur dioxide - This did not seem to distinguish wine quality in the kMeans algorithm, but mattered for hierarchical clustering.\n","- pH - unlike with the kMeans algorithm, hierarchical clustering did not seem to differentiate higher and lower quality wines based on pH, except that the poorest quality wines had a lower pH than the rest (though this seemed to be affected by the red cluster being very small). \n","- Citric acid - extreme values suggested good wines in KMeans clustering algorithm, but doesn't seem ot say much with the hierarchical clustering\n","- Density - high and low values were associated with good wines in K-means, but only low values were associated with good wines for hierarchical clustering"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"eg3sC0Ura94N"},"source":["# 3.
